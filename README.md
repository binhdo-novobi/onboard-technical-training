Onboard Technical Training
===

Here are the assignment by topics for Python and Javascript. Please follow these assignment on your own pace and submit them before the deadline. You should fork this repository privately and add your mentor as the contributor. Each topic should be done in a separate python/js file for convenience during review process.

# Python

For Python script, you should follow this structure

```
def func(a, b, c, *args, **kwargs):
    # Do something useful

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Ask user for input or to just execute the chosen function
    result = func(a, b, c=c, d=d)
```

The script can be execute, by enter the following line

```
python3 script.py
```

Or, if you have a shebang line in the script and allow to execute it, this line should work

```
$ chmod +x script.py
./script.py
```

with shebang line as follow

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
```

It's recommended to have unittest for each script!

For the final assignment, refer to `parking_lot.md` and `parking_lot_input.txt`. The final assignment must be covered with test cases.
