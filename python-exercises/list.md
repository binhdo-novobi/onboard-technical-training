List
===

# Exercise 1

Given the following list, print out all the elements that are less than `15`

```
a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
```

Extras:

- Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than `15` from this list in it and print out this new list.
- Write this in one line of Python (Hint: List comprehension).
- The program allow input a parameter called `threshold`, and return a list that contains only elements from the original list `a` that are smaller than given threshold.

# Excercise 2

Given the following list, print out all the elements in ascending order, and print out 2 separate lines, one is for even numbers and the other is for odd numbers.

```
a = [1, 2, 1, 8, 5, 3, 89, 21, 34, 55, 13]
```

Extras:
- Using `filter` function for filtering even/odd numbers

# Exercise 3

Take two lists, say for example these two:

```
a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
```

and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

# Exercise 4

Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list.

Extras:
- The program accept a parameter `n`, make a new list of only the first and the last `n` numbers of the list, in the ascending order. For the given list `a`, if `n` equals or greater than `3`, then the whole list should be printed.

# Exercise 5

Write a program (function!) that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the unique elements of the list.

Extras:

- Write two different functions to do this - one using a loop and constructing a list, and another using sets.
